      <description>2020 will be a critical year for the Indian economy. The economy appears to have recovered from the initial jitters of Goods &amp;amp; Services Tax (GST); Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). It is now time to take a step back and work on strengthning the economy, especially at a time when there are global events that can easily dampen India&amp;rsquo;s road ot recovery.</description>

      <description>In early 2019 Aadhaar was subjected to intense media scrutiny and was debated extensively. The hasty implementation of Aadhaar resulted in dilution of the scope of Aadhaar. The regulators did not estimate the impact it could have on the Indian digital ecosystem or the opportunities that arise from the platform.
Unexpected use of technology often creates new opportunities. The Govt could have helped the economy by creating an ecosystem where service providers and users could have thrived in a digital ecosystem.</description>
