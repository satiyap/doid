In early 2019 Aadhaar was subjected to intense media scrutiny and was debated extensively. The hasty implementation of Aadhaar resulted in dilution of the scope of Aadhaar.  The regulators did not estimate the impact it could have on the Indian digital ecosystem or the opportunities that arise from the platform.

Unexpected use of technology often creates new opportunities. The Govt could have helped the economy by creating an ecosystem where service providers and users could have thrived in a digital ecosystem. By introducing the Aadhaar Act as Money Bill, Govt restricted the impact it could have on the digital economy in India, limiting it to Govt expenditure (subsidies) and taxation.

Aadhaar fundamentally is a Digital Identity. The widespread enrollment campaign pledged that Indians of different social or economic backgrounds were engaged and could benefit from the system. The economically marginalized welcomed the direct bank transfer (DBT) of subsidies using Aadhaar. The middle class enjoyed the comfort of the paperless economy and easy access to online services. Corporates adored the fact that they had access to millions of verified real users.

The use of digital KYC helped the rapid growth of Jio subscriptions. At the time of launch in 2016, Jio was adding 6 lakh every day. This would not have been possible without Aadhaar forming the backbone of KYC verification, which is mandatory in the telecom sector. Other companies were quick to follow, many companies used Aadhaar as a springboard for digital KYC fin-tech being another vertical that made significant inroads using paperless digital KYC. Aadhaar enabled startups to reach millions of users quickly and build a sustainable business. The Govt leveraged the same infrastructure to empower a large section of the rural population under the PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which was the cornerstone for DBT.

Most vocal objection to Aadhaar was privacy and the fear of a surveillance state. Mainstream journalists were caught up with rhetoric and were unable to explain the concerns with Aadhaar in a simple manner. The perception that only a minority opposed Aadhaar and did not want to leave a digital trail of perceived wrongdoing made any reasonable discussion hard. It was the failure of mainstream media to explain how technology can be used (or misused).

At the time of enrollment, Aadhaar collects personal information. This includes your name, address, gender, date of birth, fingerprints, iris scans, photograph, mobile number, and email address. If you take a step back and look at how each of us shares our personal information freely. Large service providers (Google, Apple, Facebook) collect data similar to the data Aadhaar has and more. The problem is UDAI is not Google or Facebook, you cannot decide to simply opt-out of Aadhaar. The framework did not provide for a consolidated "life" view of your digital footprint.

If you think about it, Google and Aadhaar are very similar. Google tracks you across the internet using cookies with the claim to provide you with "relevant and personalized" ads. Aadhaar number can similarly be used by any entity to collect information and tie it back to you in a reliable manner. This will help them provide relevant or personalized schemes and services that are tailored for you. Aadhaar number is similar to a Google tracking cookie. You cannot delete it. It is not possible to clear your history, and you cannot create a new account.

Is Aadhaar evil? Of course not. 
Aadhaar is a digital identity, and our policymakers must understand how digital identities are used today and how this space is evolving. We must learn from other regions framing digital policies and incorporate the best practices. Europe has put in place a strong GDPR, India is in the process of releasing the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill.

GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. And non-compliance could cost companies dearly. If PDP is framed right and is implemented well, I think Aadhaar can be a force to reckon with. 

Aadhaar can empower billions of users, giving them a reliable online platform that can cater to the needs of digital India. It can be the vehicle to weed out the leaks in the system and create the well-oiled machine that India must become. However, it cannot be at the cost of privacy.  The ecosystem needs to be nurtured, but it is unlikely to take off given the current state of affairs. Recent political developments have done little to address the lack of trust in the system.
