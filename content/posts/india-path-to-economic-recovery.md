2020 will be a critical year for the Indian economy. The economy appears to have recovered from the initial jitters of Goods & Services Tax (GST); Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). It is now time to take a step back and work on strengthning the economy, especially at a time when there are global events that can easily dampen India's road ot recovery.

The GDP of India has been pegged to grow at 5.7% in 2020 and this should sound the alarm bells for our Govt. With on-going tensions in Iran, and the unstable economic situation globally - it would serve the parliment well to focus on areas of improvement on an urgent basis.

The budget session will be interesting and the govt should not get distracted by legislations that are not the need of the hour.
